> Write a sprite kit game I can launch from the command line on Mac OS. 

I'll help you create a simple SpriteKit game that can be launched from the 
command line on macOS. This will be a basic example where a sprite moves across 
the screen. [1]

First, create a new directory for your project and create the following files:

zsh
mkdir sprite-game
cd sprite-game
touch main.swift GameScene.swift


Here's the code for main.swift:

swift
import Cocoa
import SpriteKit

// Create the application
let app = NSApplication.shared
let delegate = AppDelegate()
app.delegate = delegate

// Run the application
_ = NSApplicationMain(CommandLine.argc, CommandLine.unsafeArgv)

class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
    var window: NSWindow?
    var gameView: SKView?
    
    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        // Create the window
        let rect = NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 800, height: 600)
        window = NSWindow(contentRect: rect,
                         styleMask: [.titled, .closable, .miniaturizable],
                         backing: .buffered,
                         defer: false)
        
        // Create the game view
        gameView = SKView(frame: rect)
        window?.contentView = gameView
        
        // Create and present the game scene
        let scene = GameScene(size: rect.size)
        scene.scaleMode = .aspectFit
        gameView?.presentScene(scene)
        
        // Show the window
        window?.title = "Sprite Game"
        window?.center()
        window?.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    }
}


And here's the code for GameScene.swift:

swift
import SpriteKit

class GameScene: SKScene {
    private var sprite: SKSpriteNode?
    
    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
        // Create a simple colored square sprite
        sprite = SKSpriteNode(color: .red, size: CGSize(width: 50, height: 50))
        
        if let sprite = sprite {
            sprite.position = CGPoint(x: size.width/2, y: size.height/2)
            addChild(sprite)
            
            // Add a simple animation
            let moveRight = SKAction.moveBy(x: 100, y: 0, duration: 1.0)
            let moveLeft = SKAction.moveBy(x: -100, y: 0, duration: 1.0)
            let sequence = SKAction.sequence([moveRight, moveLeft])
            let repeatForever = SKAction.repeatForever(sequence)
            
            sprite.run(repeatForever)
        }
    }
    
    override func mouseDown(with event: NSEvent) {
        // Change sprite color on click
        sprite?.color = .blue
    }
}


To compile and run the game from the command line:

zsh
swiftc main.swift GameScene.swift -o game -framework Cocoa -framework SpriteKit
./game


This will create a simple game window with a red square that moves back and 
forth. Clicking on the square will change its color to blue.

This example demonstrates basic SpriteKit functionality including: [2]
• Setting up a game window
• Creating a basic sprite
• Adding animation
• Handling mouse input

You can expand upon this by:
• Adding more sprites
• Implementing collision detection
• Adding keyboard controls
• Including game physics
• Adding scoring system
• Including sound effects

Note that SpriteKit is only available on Apple platforms (macOS, iOS, tvOS). If 
you need cross-platform compatibility, you might want to consider alternative 
game frameworks.
