Prompts to address typecast issues:
Prompt 1: using swift ui code a tic-tac-toe game

if gameBoard[pattern.first!] != "" && gameBoard[pattern.first!] == gameBoard[pattern.last!] && gameBoard[pattern.first!] == gameBoard[pattern[1]] {
                winner = gameBoard[pattern.first!]
                gameEnded = true
                return
            }


Cannot convert value of type 'Int' to expected argument type 'Set<Int>.Index'
Value of type 'Set<Int>' has no member 'last'

Prompt 2: tic tac toe check if win logic in swift
Returns same broken code 

Prompt 3: using swift ui code a tic-tac-toe game with functional checkwin checkforwinner code
Returns same broken code 

Prompt 4: swift app 2 player tic-tac-toe with string winning condition code
Returns checkWin function with proper and clever tostring typecasting using let(map)

        for pattern in winningPatterns {
            let moves = pattern.map { gameBoard[$0] }
            if moves == [player, player, player] {
                return true
            }
