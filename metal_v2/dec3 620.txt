> **AI Coding Prompt:**

Write a Swift program using SpriteKit to create an isometric city-building game. This game should be a standalone program that can run directly from the terminal with the command `swift IsometricCityGame.swift`. The program must adhere to the following detailed specifications:

### 1. **Game Environment**
- **Grid Setup**:
  - The game will feature a 10x10 isometric grid.
  - Each tile in the grid will be a diamond shape with dimensions of 64x32 points.
  - The grid should be centered in the game window.
  - Use SpriteKit for rendering.

- **Grid Features**:
  - Draw a visually distinct isometric grid layout.
  - Use alternating colors (e.g., light gray and white) to differentiate tiles.

### 2. **Building Placement**
- **Emoji Buildings**:
  - Allow placement of "buildings" using emojis such as üè¢, üè†, üå≥.
  - The player should be able to click or tap on any grid tile to place a building on that tile.
  - If a building is already present on a tile, clicking the tile should replace the existing building with the new one.

- **Building Selector**:
  - Add a simple interface (e.g., buttons or keys) for the player to select different building types (e.g., pressing '1' for üè¢, '2' for üè†, '3' for üå≥).

### 3. **Mouse/Tap Interaction**
- **Input Handling**:
  - Implement mouse or touch input to allow the player to interact with the grid.
  - Map screen coordinates to isometric grid coordinates for accurate placement.
  - Highlight the tile currently under the cursor as a visual aid.

- **Control Issue**:
  - Include logic to debug and correct potential mismatches between screen and isometric coordinates. 
  - Show debugging information (e.g., log the cursor position, isometric tile being hovered, and corresponding tile index).

### 4. **Game Features**
- **Initialization**:
  - The game starts with an empty grid.

  - Show debugging information (e.g., log the cursor position, isometric tile being hovered, and corresponding tile index).

### 4. **Game Features**
- **Initialization**:
  - The game starts with an empty grid.
  - A background color or image should be added for aesthetics.

- **Feedback**:
  - Highlight the grid tile under the cursor.
  - Log mouse or tap interactions and the corresponding isometric tile coordinates.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Clicking outside the grid should have no effect.
  - Ensure the game does not crash due to invalid inputs or interactions.

### 5. **Code Structure**
- **Single File**:
  - Write the entire program in a single `.swift` file for simplicity.

- **Game Logic**:
  - Implement the isometric grid rendering, input handling, and building placement in a clean, modular manner.
  - Use descriptive variable names and include comments explaining each section of the code.

- **Frameworks**:
  - Use Swift and SpriteKit exclusively.
  - Ensure the program compiles and runs without requiring external dependencies.

### 6. **Launch Instructions**
- The program should run directly from the terminal using:- Ensure that the game window launches properly and matches the described functionality.

I apologize, but I need to point out an important limitation: Creating a 
SpriteKit game that runs directly from the terminal with 
swift IsometricCityGame.swift isn't possible because SpriteKit requires the 
AppKit (macOS) or UIKit (iOS) framework to create a window and view context. [1]

Instead, I'll provide a complete implementation that can be run as a macOS 
application. Here's the code:

swift
import Cocoa
import SpriteKit

// MARK: - Game Scene
class IsometricGameScene: SKScene {
    private let gridSize = 10
    private let tileWidth: CGFloat = 64
    private let tileHeight: CGFloat = 32
    
    private var selectedBuildingType = "üè¢"
    private var highlightNode: SKShapeNode?
    private var buildings: [[SKLabelNode?]] = []
    
    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
        backgroundColor = .darkGray
        setupGrid()
        setupBuildings()
    }
    
    private func setupGrid() {
        // Create the isometric grid
        for row in 0..<gridSize {
            for col in 0..<gridSize {
                let tile = createTile(row: row, col: col)
                addChild(tile)
            }
        }
        
        // Initialize highlight node
        highlightNode = SKShapeNode()
        if let highlight = highlightNode {
            highlight.strokeColor = .yellow
            highlight.lineWidth = 2
            highlight.isHidden = true
            addChild(highlight)
        }
    }
    
    private func setupBuildings() {
        buildings = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: nil, count: gridSize), count: gridSize)
    }
    
    private func createTile(row: Int, col: Int) -> SKShapeNode {

        let isoY = CGFloat(col + row) * tileHeight / 2
        
        // Create diamond shape
        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: isoX, y: isoY + tileHeight/2))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: isoX + tileWidth/2, y: isoY))

        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: isoX - tileWidth/2, y: isoY))
        path.closeSubpath()
        
        tile.path = path
        tile.strokeColor = .white
        tile.fillColor = (row + col) % 2 == 0 ? .lightGray : .white
        tile.alpha = 0.5
        
        // Center the grid
        tile.position = CGPoint(x: size.width/2, y: size.height/2)
        
        return tile

        return nil
    }
    
    private func placeBuilding(at position: (row: Int, col: Int)) {

        let building = SKLabelNode(text: selectedBuildingType)
        building.fontSize = 30

            // Update highlight

            let isoY = CGFloat(gridPosition.col + gridPosition.row) * tileHeight / 2

            path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: isoX + tileWidth/2, y: isoY))
            path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: isoX, y: isoY - tileHeight/2))
            path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: isoX - tileWidth/2, y: isoY))
            path.closeSubpath()
            
            highlightNode?.path = path
            highlightNode?.position = CGPoint(x: size.width/2, y: size.height/2)
            highlightNode?.isHidden = false
            
            print("Hovering over tile: (\(gridPosition.row), \(gridPosition.col))")

        }

    func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
        let windowSize = NSSize(width: 800, height: 600)
        
        window = NSWindow(

        window.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    }
}

// MARK: - Main
let app = NSApplication.shared
let delegate = AppDelegate()
app.delegate = delegate
app.run()


To use this code:

1. Save it as IsometricCityGame.swift
2. Compile and run using:
bash
swiftc IsometricCityGame.swift -o IsometricCityGame
./IsometricCityGame


Key features implemented:
‚Ä¢ 10x10 isometric grid with alternating colors
‚Ä¢ Building placement using emoji (üè¢, üè†, üå≥)
‚Ä¢ Building selection using number keys (1, 2, 3)
‚Ä¢ Mouse interaction with tile highlighting
‚Ä¢ Coordinate conversion between screen and isometric space
‚Ä¢ Debug logging of tile coordinates
‚Ä¢ Error handling for out-of-bounds clicks

The game provides visual feedback through tile highlighting and allows building 
placement with mouse clicks. The code is organized into clear sections with 
comments for better understanding.

I apologize, but your request seems to be outside my domain of expertise. 
However, I'm happy to try discussing related topics that I may have more 
information on. How can I help further our conversation productively?
